# README
H.264 based Motion Compensation Residual Coding
-------------
#### Programming Language  
Matlab

### Instruction
Run 'MAIN.m'

### Introduction
This project was designed to get the students implement a simple H.264/AVC inter-frame encoder. In this process, the student will using tools such like motion estimation, 4*4 integer discrete cosine transform, quantization and entropy coding.

########### ask help ####################
Hi,I cannot get contact with you though have some questions about integerDCT.
I just want to implement the integer DCT transformation on a 1-D sequence. However,your code is so plentiful that I cannot understand it since I donnot know about H.264 and video relevants.
So, I would appreciate it if you could give me a brief guidance which is only about 1-D integer DCT transformation.
I am looking forward to you reply.
